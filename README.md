# Drag to form (Firefox Add-On)

## Fill form fields from a list of text by drag&drop

This simple Addon gives you the ability to maintain different groups of Text strings. These Text's are available in the sidebar and/or as a popup list from the browsers toolbar.   
Filling a Field of a Form is as easy as dragging such text items to the field and drop it in.  
  
In general it can be used to drag&drop text items to any location that is capable to accept a drop, but filling form fields is the major use case.
